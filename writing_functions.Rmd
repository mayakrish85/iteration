Load key packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

## Writing my first function

As an example, here is a z-score computation:

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(n = 25, mean = 10, sd = 3.5)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

Now I'll write a function to do this.

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("x needs to be numeric")
  }
  
  if (length(x) < 5) {
    stop("you need at least 5 numbers to compute the z score")
  }
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
}

z_scores(x = x_vec)
```

Does this always work?

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_scores(x = 3) # can't get SD of one number
z_scores(x = c("my", "name", "is", "maya")) # not numeric vector

```
