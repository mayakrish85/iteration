Load key packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

## Writing my first function

As an example, here is a z-score computation:

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(n = 25, mean = 10, sd = 3.5)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

Now I'll write a function to do this.

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
}

z_scores(x = x_vec)
```
